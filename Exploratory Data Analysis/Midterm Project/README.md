STAT 847: Midterm Project

Due Tuesday, Feb 28 at 11:59pm Eastern Time

PICK ONE Kaggle EDA

This is the Feb. 4 version of this assignment. Please check back on Learn over the next week

or so to make sure there are no updated versions with helpful clarifications.

Total Score: 100

Your midterm must be submitted by the due date listed at the top of this document, and it must be submitted
electronically in .pdf format via Crowdmark.


Choose one of the follow datasets to run an exploratory data analysis on, and write a report that answers
everything on the dataset-specfic checklist.

Several of these datasets are new to Kaggle (every one but the covid one). If you decide to get some exposure
on Kaggle, you could publish your midterm project there as a JuPyTer (Julia, Python, R) notebook and be
(one of) the first to do so, thereby being the analysis that gets read the most. At the end of this assignment
is optional notes on how to do so.


For plots, base R or GGplot is fine. Plot does not need to be up to Stat 842 standards, but proper titles
and axes are required. Also las=1 is a good setting. Have a look in the Week 02 version of the 2022 notes
for some basic plotting information if you need some, or ask on Piazza.


Compile the results from all your tasks into a Markdown file. Include your code and 500-1000
words worth of commentary (in total, not in addition to the answers to all the questions. Code
does not count towards word count. Plots are nice, but not worth 1000 words.)
